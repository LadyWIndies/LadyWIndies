Just starting out..baby steps


Hello out there big beautiful world! I am just a an old soul/geek looking to change the world. As the saying goes, "a little goes a long way." I am a country girl living in the faster pace of Maryland life which is a culture shock...not for me but more so for the people of Maryland! : ) You have to be able to adapt in order to survive and that's exactly what I am doing...anyone care to join me?
